DESCRIPTION
    MailMover was originally written to be used in conjunction with OpenEMM,
    an open-source newsletter management application. OpenEMM does not,
    itself provide support for *DomainKeys Identified Mail* (*DKIM*). So,
    the idea was born to write a tool which monitors OpenEMM's own mail
    queue directory, signs outbound mails and moves them to the system-wide
    mail queue (/var/spool/mailq on Debian based systems) as soon as they
    land there. From there on, the system-wide sendmail process takes over.

CONFIGURATION
    MailMover reads in a configuration file that is per default located in
    ${HOME}/.mailmover.conf. The config file is made up of command line
    options minus the preceding dashes as keys. Comments on a line of their
    own preceded by a hash sign (#) are ignored, as are blank lines and
    trailing whitespace.

    Command line options take precedence over configuration file options.
    Configuration file options take precedence over default options.

BUGS
    A few. Probably. Let me know if you find any. :-)
